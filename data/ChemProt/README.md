# ChemProt Dataset

This repository contains instructions on how to access and organize the ChemProt dataset. Please follow the guidelines below to download and organize the dataset.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to access and organize the ChemProt dataset:

### 1. Download the Dataset

You can download the DrugProt dataset from the following link: [Download ChemProt Dataset](https://biocreative.bioinformatics.udel.edu/news/corpora/chemprot-corpus-biocreative-vi/).

### 2. Organize the Dataset

After downloading the dataset, unzip each folder. Inside each folder, you will find files named "chemprot_development," "chemprot_test," "chemprot_sample," and "chemprot_train," each containing several .txt files. To properly structure the dataset, place the aforementioned folders inside the ChemProt directory, resulting in the following architecture:

- **Training Data**: `data/ChemProt/chemprot_training/` folder.

- **Development Data**: `data/ChemProt/chemprot_development/` folder.

- **Sample Data**: `data/ChemProt/chemprot_sample/` folder.

- **Test Data**: `data/ChemProt/chemprot_test_gs/` folder.

Ensure that the data is organized in the specified directory structure.

- ChemProt/
   - chemprot_development/
   - chemprot_sample/
   - chemprot_test_gs/
   - chemprot_train/
